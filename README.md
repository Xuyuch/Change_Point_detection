# Change_Point_detection
This resository records the usgae of change point detection on HiRES paper. Neuro differentiate from neural ectoderm->neuroepthelial-> neuro plate -> neuro tube -.RGL path was used. 
Some bad UMAP removing was did. And it will definately hurt the results. However, this is a illustrative test pipeline for change point detection, so I would not recommend intepret the result. Also, it is an arxiv and would be modified later.

See the HiRES_changetime_detection.py file for more information
